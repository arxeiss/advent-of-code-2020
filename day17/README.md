As your flight slowly drifts through the sky, the Elves at the Mythical Information Bureau at the North Pole contact you. They'd like some help debugging a malfunctioning experimental energy source aboard one of their super-secret imaging satellites.

The experimental energy source is based on cutting-edge technology: a set of Conway Cubes contained in a pocket dimension! When you hear it's having problems, you can't help but agree to take a look.

## --- Part 1 ---

I was trying to do it at the first by hand, but my result was off just after first cube. The below explanation is from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ker0wi/2020_day_17_part_1_sample_input_wrong/):

It was confusing to me too, but it is correct.<br>
The sample input does not show the full 5x5x3 grid<br>
For z = -1 after first cycle

So it is the same as the example, just that the `.`'s are not present

This confused me too, I was expecting dots on all sides for some reason and I thought my grid was off by one vertically. But since it's an infinite grid in every direction the extras don't actually matter and I guess they were omitted in the example.

The pocket dimension contains an infinite 3-dimensional grid. At every integer 3-dimensional coordinate (`x,y,z`), there exists a single cube which is either **active** or **inactive**.

In the initial state of the pocket dimension, almost all cubes start **inactive**. The only exception to this is a small flat region of cubes (your puzzle input); the cubes in this region start in the specified **active** (`#`) or **inactive** (`.`) state.

The energy source then proceeds to boot up by executing six **cycles**.

Each cube only ever considers its **neighbors**: any of the 26 other cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most `1`. For example, given the cube at `x=1,y=2,z=3`, its neighbors include the cube at `x=2,y=2,z=2`, the cube at `x=0,y=2,z=3`, and so on.

During a cycle, **all** cubes **simultaneously** change their state according to the following rules:

- If a cube is **active** and **exactly `2` or `3`** of its neighbors are also active, the cube remains **active**. Otherwise, the cube becomes **inactive**.
- If a cube is **inactive** but **exactly `3`** of its neighbors are active, the cube becomes **active**. Otherwise, the cube remains **inactive**.

The engineers responsible for this experimental energy source would like you to simulate the pocket dimension and determine what the configuration of cubes should be at the end of the six-cycle boot process.

For example, consider the following initial state:

```
.#.
..#
###
```

Even though the pocket dimension is 3-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1 region of the 3-dimensional space.)

Simulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each given `z` coordinate (and the frame of view follows the active cells in each cycle):

```
Before any cycles:

z=0
.#.
..#
###

After 1 cycle:

z=-1
#..
..#
.#.

z=0
#.#
.##
.#.

z=1
#..
..#
.#.

After 2 cycles:

z=-2
.....

..#..
.....
.....

z=-1
..#..
.#..#

.#...

z=0
##...

.###.

z=1
..#..
.#..#
....#
.#...
.....

z=2
.....
.....
..#..
.....

After 3 cycles:

z=-1

```

After the full six-cycle boot process completes, **`112`** cubes are left in the **active** state.

Starting with your given initial configuration, simulate six cycles. **How many cubes are left in the active state after the sixth cycle?**

## --- Part 2 ---

For some reason, your simulated results don't match what the experimental energy source engineers expected. Apparently, the pocket dimension actually has **four spatial dimensions**, not three.

The pocket dimension contains an infinite 4-dimensional grid. At every integer 4-dimensional coordinate (`x,y,z,w`), there exists a single cube (really, a **hypercube**) which is still either **active** or **inactive**.

Each cube only ever considers its **neighbors**: any of the 80 other cubes where any of their coordinates differ by at most `1`. For example, given the cube at `x=1,y=2,z=3,w=4`, its neighbors include the cube at `x=2,y=2,z=3,w=3`, the cube at `x=0,y=2,z=3,w=4`, and so on.

The initial state of the pocket dimension still consists of a small flat region of cubes. Furthermore, the same rules for cycle updating still apply: during each cycle, consider the **number of active neighbors** of each cube.

For example, consider the same initial state as in the example above. Even though the pocket dimension is 4-dimensional, this initial state represents a small 2-dimensional slice of it. (In particular, this initial state defines a 3x3x1x1 region of the 4-dimensional space.)

Simulating a few cycles from this initial state produces the following configurations, where the result of each cycle is shown layer-by-layer at each given `z` and `w` coordinate:

```
Before any cycles:

z=0, w=0
.#.
..#
###

After 1 cycle:

z=-1, w=-1
#..
..#
.#.

z=0, w=-1
#..
..#

z=1, w=-1
#..

z=-1, w=0

z=-1, w=1

z=0, w=1

z=1, w=1

After 2 cycles:

After the full six-cycle boot process completes, **`848`** cubes are left in the **active** state.

Starting with your given initial configuration, simulate six cycles in a 4-dimensional space. **How many cubes are left in the active state after the sixth cycle?**
